            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I design and develop responsive websites tailored to meet your business needs.Web Development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experienc.Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming and the platforms on which they are working.Web development skills are in high demand worldwide and well paid too – making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.The field of web development is generally broken down into front-end (the user-facing side) and back-end (the server side). Let’s delve into the details.</p>

            <h3>UI/UX Design</h3>
            <p>Creating intuitive and engaging user experiences that delight users.UX design focuses on the interaction that a human user has with everyday products and services. The goal of UX design is to make using these products and services, both digital or physical, easy, logical, and fun.You may have spent your fair share of time searching reviews for a new coffee maker. In essence, you’re not only looking for a new appliance, but a product with features that will deliver you, the user, a great experience.For example, an anti-drip spout, auto-shut off, and a reusable basket are all features that meet the user’s needs, make it easy to use, and give the user control and freedom when using. This is similar to the way UX / UI designers think when developing a web application. They want the user experience to be easy and intuitive.</p>
